## 1. Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Life-Saving Traffic Prediction Model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and an Ambulance Routing Model for classification using LSTM. The Life-Saving Traffic Prediction Model predicts traffic intensity, and the Ambulance Routing Model assists in determining the destination for an ambulance based on its current location.

This project is divided into several steps:

Data Collection: Load historical traffic data from a CSV file.
Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, normalize traffic intensity, and one-hot encode the location column.
Build the Life-Saving Traffic Prediction Model: Prepare the data, scale features, reshape input data, and create the LSTM model for traffic prediction.
Design the Ambulance Routing Model: Load ambulance data from a CSV file, preprocess it, and create an LSTM model for classification.
Incorporate Emergency SOS Message Functionality: Implement a function to send SOS messages to nearby vehicles based on the ambulance's current location in emergency situations.
Implement Safety Checks for Responsible Usage: Create a function to handle incoming SOS messages with safety checks to ensure appropriate and responsible usage.
Test and Validate: Evaluate the performance of the life-saving traffic prediction and ambulance routing models using historical data and simulations.
Implement Interactive Life-Saving Traffic Prediction: Develop a user interface to interactively predict traffic intensity for a given timestamp and location and provide life-saving suggestions based on the intensity prediction.

## 3. Life-Saving Traffic Prediction Model
The Life-Saving Traffic Prediction Model uses historical traffic data to predict traffic intensity for a given timestamp and location. The steps involved are:

Load historical traffic data from the CSV file.
Preprocess the data by normalizing the "traffic_intensity" column and one-hot encoding the "location" column.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Scale the features and reshape the input data to match the LSTM model's requirements.
Create and train the LSTM model for life-saving traffic prediction.

##4. Ambulance Routing Model
The Ambulance Routing Model helps determine the destination for an ambulance based on its current location. The steps involved are:

Load ambulance data from the CSV file.
Preprocess the data by one-hot encoding the "current_location" column and encoding the "destination" labels using LabelEncoder.
Create and train the LSTM model for classification.

## 5. Incorporate Emergency SOS Message Functionality
The project incorporates Emergency SOS Message functionality to send SOS messages to nearby vehicles based on the ambulance's current location in emergency situations. It includes a sample function to demonstrate sending SOS messages and the required calculations to find the closest nearby vehicle.

## 6. Safety Checks for Responsible Usage
The Emergency SOS Message functionality also includes safety checks to ensure responsible usage. The sample function handles incoming SOS messages and performs safety checks, such as checking for the word "emergency" in the message content. If the message is validated as an emergency, it takes appropriate actions, such as sending alerts to authorities and nearby vehicles.

## 7. Testing and Validation
The performance of the Life-Saving Traffic Prediction Model and the Ambulance Routing Model can be evaluated using historical data and simulations. The models are tested using the evaluate method, and the test loss and accuracy are calculated.

## 8. Interactive Life-Saving Traffic Prediction
The project provides an interactive user interface for life-saving traffic prediction. The user can input a timestamp and location to get predictions for traffic intensity. The predictions are mapped to human-readable traffic levels, and life-saving suggestions are provided based on the intensity prediction.

Note: This documentation provides an overview of the project's functionality and steps. Before running the code, ensure you have the required data and model files. Also, customize the code as needed based on your specific use case and data.
